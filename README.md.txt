Welcome to the Tabletop Simulator Warhammer 40,000 Model Catalogue.

So, what is this and why? Simply put it's the obsessive compulsive result of watching people, especially newcomers, completely lost as to where models for TTS40k games can be found. So to the best of my abilities I searched the Archive and Workshop high and low for the models that best represented the options available for every faction, organized into save files for easy access. Some of these are newly organized collections, some of these are from existing ones, some exist but have minor modifications, but the intent is to make everything easy to find while also avoiding multi-gig MEGA or torrent downloads. Also, hopefully, to avoid GW dropping an exterminatus on our model options by bypassing direct mod usage.

At this stage of release the catalogue is still incomplete. There's various missing options I'm aware of and will be working to fill those in, starting with non-codex compliant Space Marine factions specifically the missing Space Wolves characters. Forge World/Horus Heresy units usable in 40k are scattershot as well, and right now will only be included if they were initially part of the chosen collection. This may change later.

I'll list everything I know is missing below. For now, I hope these collections come in handy.

Missing options and priority list:
Blood Angels Tactical Squad heavy flamer
Space Wolves various special characters and infantry options
Company Veterans with color swap options
Death Guard weapon options
Tau special characters
Craftworld special character proxy replacements
Find something that can make decent Fallen for Chaos Marines
Sisters of Battle various options (waiting for GW to release more scans)
Search for various Forge World options

A note on Space Marines:
There's a lot, and I mean a LOT, if Space Marine collections saved in this catalogue. So many I feel it necessary to create a short guide for finding what you need.
1. Check the collection for the Chapter you want to play first.
2. If it's not there, check Space Marine Primaris and Extras (recolorable)
3. For Dark Angels, Space Wolves, and Blood Angels specific units check the appropriately titled Codex Units collection
4. For units from the Codex Supplements and miscellaneous options, check Space Marine Supplement Units
5. Centurions have their own collection. Sadly no Assault Centurions exist on TTS in any form. Proxy Assault ones with Heavy Bolter Centurions.
6. For Firstborn (ie: non-Primaris) Lieutenants (Battle Leaders if you use Space Wolves) use the Tactical Veteran Sergeant/Assault Veteran Sergeant models. For Battle Leaders on Thunderwolf use an appropriate Thunderwolf Cavalry model.
7. All special characters available are in the Special Character collection. If it isn't, I wasn't able to find them and are working on adding them.

Probably a bunch of others I'm unaware of. If you see your work in here, poke me (Sig) on the discord and I'll make sure you get added to this list.
